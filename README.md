## Mumble - decentralized, P2P communication system for humans and Internet of Things devices.



What is Mumble?
-----------------

Mumble is an open source, peer-to-peer communication network for humans and machines. We aim to solve secure, decentralized network formation with Mumble. Mumble uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: discovering contacts, persisting the data and routing messages are carried out collectively by the network. It is primarily secured by elliptic curve public/private key cryptography infrastructure (PPKI). 

Mumble comes with video calls, audio calls, text chat, file transfer, screen sharing, and the ability to connect to your Internet-of-Things devices.

Mumble is optimized for the Internet-of-Things. Along with complying with open security and communication standards our developers take an active role in the W3C Web of Things Initiative (https://github.com/w3c/web-of-things-framework) and mirror all WoT standards in the Mumble codebase.

Building Mumble
-----------------

If you would like to build Mumble from the source instead of using the prebuilt binaries  follow the build workflow described in [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/mumble/mumbleui/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Mumble Core.




Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.
